# Tic — A Stickies-style floating task list for macOS

## Context

Tic is a "state of the art" task-list app for macOS, written in **Swift**. The distinguishing
idea: unlike most task apps that hide in the menu bar, **Tic lives on the desktop as floating
sticky notes** (Stickies-app style). Each note is a checklist you drop your daily or planned
tasks into and glance at without opening anything.

Dev environment is bleeding-edge — **macOS 26.5, Xcode 26, Swift 6.2** — but the app must run
on **older Macs too**, so we deploy back to **macOS 14 Sonoma** and use Liquid Glass only as a
progressive enhancement where available. Stack: **SwiftUI + SQLite (GRDB)**.

Decisions confirmed:
- **Scope:** Lean MVP first (core sticky checklist), layer features later.
- **App style:** Hybrid — dock icon **and** a menu bar item.
- **Data:** Local **SQLite via GRDB.swift**, schema kept sync-friendly for future iCloud sync.
- **Minimum OS:** macOS 14 Sonoma (keeps GRDB + MenuBarExtra; covers Macs ~2017+).
- **Look:** Solid colored "paper" notes are the universal baseline; **Liquid Glass** is an
  opt-in per-note style shown only on macOS 26+ (`if #available(macOS 26)`), gracefully
  falling back to solid on older systems. Not required.

Out of scope for v1 (deliberately deferred): daily/planned rollover, recurring tasks, due
dates/Reminders integration, tags/priority, global hotkey, iCloud sync. Models and window
layer are designed so these slot in cleanly.

## Architecture overview

The core trick of a Stickies-style app: regular SwiftUI windows can't be borderless, drag-
anywhere, float-on-top, and show-on-all-Spaces. So:

- **Views:** SwiftUI (task rows, editing, header, quick-add).
- **Windows:** AppKit `NSPanel`, one per note, each hosting a SwiftUI `NoteView` via
  `NSHostingView`. A manager class owns the `Note.id → NSPanel` map.
- **Persistence:** **SQLite via GRDB.swift** (SPM dependency). A single shared `AppDatabase`
  (wrapping a `DatabaseQueue`) is injected into the menu bar scene and every panel's hosted
  view. `.sqlite` file lives in Application Support; `ValueObservation` pushes live updates to
  SwiftUI.
- **App shell:** SwiftUI `App` providing `MenuBarExtra` + `Settings`, plus an
  `NSApplicationDelegateAdaptor` (`AppDelegate`) that restores/creates/saves panels.
- **Deployment target:** macOS 14 Sonoma. Liquid Glass (`.glassEffect()`) is used only behind
  `if #available(macOS 26, *)`, with a solid-color fallback below.

## Data model (SQLite / GRDB, sync-friendly)

Two tables defined through a GRDB `DatabaseMigrator` (versioned migrations, so the schema can
evolve safely). Records are plain Swift structs conforming to `Codable`, `FetchableRecord`,
`MutablePersistableRecord`. Sync-friendly by design: stable `UUID` primary keys + `updatedAt`
timestamps (room for last-write-wins later), foreign key with `ON DELETE CASCADE`.

- **`Note`** (`Models/Note.swift`) → table `note`: `id: UUID` (PK), `title: String`,
  `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `color: String` (→ `NoteColor`), `material: String`
  (→ `NoteMaterial` glass/solid), window frame `frameX/Y/W/H: Double`, `floatOnTop: Bool`,
  `showOnAllSpaces: Bool`, `isCollapsed: Bool`, `sortIndex: Int`.
- **`TaskItem`** (`Models/TaskItem.swift`) → table `task`: `id: UUID` (PK),
  `noteId: UUID` (FK → `note.id`, cascade delete), `text: String`, `isDone: Bool`,
  `sortIndex: Int`, `createdAt`, `completedAt: Date?`.
- **`AppDatabase`** (`Database/AppDatabase.swift`) — opens the `DatabaseQueue`, runs migrations,
  and exposes CRUD + `ValueObservation` queries (e.g. observe all notes; observe tasks for a
  note id) that SwiftUI subscribes to.
- **`NoteColor`** (`Models/NoteColor.swift`): enum of themes (yellow, pink, blue, green,
  graphite…) → background + accent `Color`.
- **`NoteMaterial`** (`Models/NoteMaterial.swift`): `.solid` (baseline) / `.glass`
  (rendered only on macOS 26+, falls back to `.solid` below).

## Window layer (AppKit)

- **`Windows/NotePanel.swift`** — `NSPanel` subclass: `styleMask` `[.borderless, .resizable,
  .nonactivatingPanel]`, `isMovableByWindowBackground = true` (drag from anywhere),
  `isFloatingPanel`, rounded corners + shadow. `level` = `.floating` when `floatOnTop` else
  `.normal`; `collectionBehavior` includes `.canJoinAllSpaces` when `showOnAllSpaces`, plus
  `.fullScreenAuxiliary`.
- **`Windows/NoteWindowManager.swift`** — owns `[UUID: NotePanel]`. Responsibilities:
  `openNote`, `closeNote`, `restoreAll` (on launch, one panel per saved `Note`), and persisting
  frame back to the `Note` on `NSWindow.didMove`/`didResize` notifications. Holds a reference to
  the shared `AppDatabase`.

## App shell & menu bar

- **`TicApp.swift`** — `@main`. Builds the shared `AppDatabase`; injects it everywhere.
  `MenuBarExtra` (menu bar item) with: **New Note** (⌘N), **Show/Hide All**, today's open-task
  count, Settings, Quit. A `Settings` scene for preferences. `NSApplicationDelegateAdaptor`
  wires in the delegate. `LSUIElement` stays NO so the dock icon remains (hybrid).
- **`AppDelegate.swift`** — on `applicationDidFinishLaunching`, calls
  `NoteWindowManager.restoreAll()`; provides dock-menu New Note; reopens a note panel when none
  exist on dock-icon click.

## SwiftUI views

- **`Views/NoteView.swift`** — root per-note view: header + scrollable task list + quick-add.
  Background comes from `GlassBackground` (see below). Rounded corners matching the panel.
- **`Views/NoteHeaderView.swift`** — editable title, color picker, glass/solid toggle,
  float-on-top toggle, collapse button, add-note/close buttons.
- **`Views/TaskRowView.swift`** — SF Symbol checkbox (`circle` → `checkmark.circle.fill`),
  inline-editable text, strikethrough + dimmed when done, delete on hover.
- **`Views/QuickAddField.swift`** — text field; Return appends a `TaskItem` and keeps focus.
- Reordering via `List` `.onMove` (simplest) updating `sortIndex`.
- **`Views/GlassBackground.swift`** — view modifier encapsulating the background: solid
  `NoteColor` fill everywhere by default; when the note's material is `.glass` **and**
  `#available(macOS 26, *)`, apply `.glassEffect(...)`, otherwise fall back to solid. Reused by
  note body and header.

## Proposed file structure

Built as a **Swift Package** (executable target) — `swift build` / `swift run` from the CLI,
and `Package.swift` opens directly in Xcode for GUI editing. No `.xcodeproj` to maintain.

```
Package.swift            (executable target Tic, GRDB dependency, platforms macOS 14)
PLAN.md
Sources/Tic/
  TicApp.swift
  AppDelegate.swift
  Database/      AppDatabase.swift  (GRDB queue + migrations + queries)
  Models/        Note.swift  TaskItem.swift  NoteColor.swift  NoteMaterial.swift
  Windows/       NotePanel.swift  NoteWindowManager.swift
  Views/         NoteView.swift  NoteHeaderView.swift  TaskRowView.swift
                 QuickAddField.swift  GlassBackground.swift
  MenuBar/       MenuBarContent.swift
```

Note: for the MVP, `NoteColor` themes are defined in Swift (no asset catalog), so the
executable needs no resource bundle. App icon, entitlements, and a proper `.app` bundle are
deferred to the distribution step.

## Build order (implementation phases)

1. **Scaffold** the Swift package: `Package.swift` (executable target `Tic`, platforms
   `.macOS(.v14)`, dependency **GRDB 7.x**). Identifier `com.kasvith.tic` is set on the app's
   activation/bundle later when packaged; for dev we run the executable directly.
2. **Database + models**: `AppDatabase` (queue + migrations) and the `Note`/`TaskItem` records;
   seed a sample note so there's something to render.
3. **Single floating panel**: `NotePanel` + `NoteWindowManager` hosting a placeholder
   `NoteView`; verify it floats, drags from anywhere, resizes.
4. **Task list UI**: add / check / edit / delete / reorder, persisting through `AppDatabase`,
   with the list driven by `ValueObservation`.
5. **Per-note styling**: color themes + glass/solid background; float-on-top &
   show-on-all-Spaces toggles wired to panel behavior.
6. **Persistence of window state**: save frame/flags; `restoreAll()` on launch.
7. **Menu bar + dock**: `MenuBarExtra` actions, ⌘N, Show/Hide All, today count.
8. **(Optional in v1)** Launch-at-login via `SMAppService`.

## Verification

- Build with **`swift build`** (resolves the GRDB SPM dependency; CI-style check) and launch
  with **`swift run`**. The executable calls `NSApp.setActivationPolicy(.regular)` to get a
  dock icon + foreground focus without a bundle. `Package.swift` also opens in Xcode.
- **Compatibility check:** on macOS 26 a glass note renders frosted; on macOS 14–15 the same
  note falls back to solid color with no crash (test the `#available` path).
- **Inspect the data:** open the `.sqlite` file in Application Support with any SQLite browser
  and confirm `note`/`task` rows match the UI.
- Manual end-to-end pass:
  1. Launch → menu bar item + dock icon appear; saved notes restore as floating panels.
  2. **New Note** (menu bar / ⌘N) → a sticky panel appears.
  3. Add several tasks, check some (strikethrough), edit text, reorder, delete one.
  4. Move + resize the panel; toggle glass↔solid and a color; toggle float-on-top (note stays
     above other apps) and show-on-all-Spaces (switch desktops — note follows).
  5. **Quit and relaunch** → notes, tasks, positions, colors, and flags all restored.
  6. Menu bar shows correct count of today's open tasks.
- Optionally drive the built app with the `run` / `verify` skills once it compiles.

## MCP: AI agents drive Tic (planned, next)

Agents (Claude Desktop/Code, Cursor, VS Code, Codex, Gemini, Windsurf, Zed, …) get **full
parity with a human** over notes and tasks through an MCP server, and the UI reflects every
agent write instantly. Off by default; a menu-bar item **AI Agents (MCP)…** opens the setup
window that holds the toggle and per-client install instructions.

### The one decision that keeps this small: the server runs *inside* the running Tic

- **Live updates cost nothing.** Every tool writes through the existing `AppDatabase`, and the
  existing `ValueObservation` streams (`observeTasks`, `observeTaskImageCrops`, `observeNotes`)
  already push those writes into the views. A standalone `tic-mcp` binary writing the SQLite file
  would need a hand-built cross-process notification channel: GRDB does not observe other
  processes' writes.
- **One gap to close:** an open note's `NoteController` streams its tasks but holds its `note`
  row as a one-time snapshot, and `NoteView` seeds the title field once. Add
  `AppDatabase.observeNote(id:)` (per-row twin of `observeNotes()`), subscribe in
  `NoteController.start()`, diff each emission against the current `note` and fire the existing
  closures when their fields changed (`onApplyBehavior` for float/all-Spaces, `onSetCollapsed`
  for roll-up). Diffing against the optimistic in-memory value makes the controller's own writes
  echo back as no-ops. `NoteView` syncs `titleText` from `controller.note.title` while the field
  isn't focused. Colour/material/list options already render from `controller.note`.
- **Window actions go direct, not via reconcile.** Open/close/bring-to-front/move hop to the
  main actor and call `NoteWindowManager` (`openNote`, new `closeNote(id)`, `setFrame(id:)`).
  Reconciling panels from the notes observer was considered and dropped: `openNote` writes
  `isOpen` asynchronously, so an emission in that gap looks like a closed note with a panel.
  A programmatic `setFrame` fires `windowDidMove`/`windowDidResize`, so the existing debounced
  save persists an agent move with no new code.

### Transport: stdio to the client, a Unix socket inside

```
Claude / Cursor / … ──stdio──▶ Tic --mcp (proxy) ──unix socket──▶ Tic.app: MCPServer ─▶ AppDatabase
                                                    one connection per client   one serialised writer
```

- **Clients see stdio only**, the one transport every MCP client supports. Every client config
  is identical: `command: <Tic.app>/Contents/MacOS/Tic`, `args: ["--mcp"]`.
- **The proxy is the same binary.** `@main` on `TicApp` becomes a `main.swift`: `--mcp` runs
  `MCPProxy` (pipe stdin → socket, socket → stdout, exit on EOF) instead of the GUI. No second
  target, no packaging change. If the socket is missing, launch Tic via
  `NSWorkspace.openApplication(at:)` without activating and retry for a few seconds; if it's
  still missing (MCP off) print a one-line hint to stderr and exit 1, which clients surface in
  their logs. Under `swift run` the path is `.build/debug/Tic`, so dev testing works the same.
- **The inner hop is a Unix domain socket** at `~/Library/Application Support/Tic/mcp.sock`
  (Network.framework: `NWListener` with `requiredLocalEndpoint = .unix(path:)`, available since
  macOS 10.15). Chosen over localhost TCP because it needs no port, triggers no macOS firewall
  prompt, and is a 0600 file in the user's Library, the same exposure as the SQLite file, not a
  port open to every local process and browser page. Unlink a stale socket before binding.
  (`sun_path` max is 104 bytes; the App Support path is ~50.)
- **Many agents at once** just work: the listener accepts one connection per client, each is its
  own MCP session (own `initialize`, own request ids, handled in order per connection), and all
  writes serialise through the `DatabaseQueue` (`MAX(sortIndex)+1` is computed inside the write).
  Two agents editing one task is last-write-wins, the same rule as user-vs-agent today.
- Skipped: Streamable HTTP (needs an HTTP+SSE server or a dependency, Origin/auth per spec, the
  firewall prompt, and Claude Desktop's config file still only spawns stdio). Add if a client
  that can't spawn a process shows up.

### Protocol: hand-rolled, five methods

Newline-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0, exactly MCP's stdio framing, so the proxy pipes bytes
untouched. `MCPServer` handles `initialize` (echo the client's `protocolVersion` when known,
else ours; `capabilities.tools`; a short `instructions` string describing notes, the
three-level outline and the completion cascade), `notifications/initialized` (ignored),
`ping`, `tools/list`, `tools/call`; anything else → `-32601`. The dispatcher is a pure
`handle(line) async -> String?` over an `AppDatabase`, so tests drive it with strings on an
in-memory DB. The official swift-sdk is skipped (three transitive dependencies for five
methods); switch if resources/prompts/sampling are ever wanted.

### Tools: everything a human can do to notes and tasks

| Tool | Covers | Path |
|---|---|---|
| `list_notes`, `get_note` | Lists palette; reading a note (tasks with id/text/level/done/has_image) | reads |
| `create_note` | ⌘N, with title/color/material/tasks/frame; cascaded placement like `newNote` | insert + `openNote` |
| `update_note` | title, color, material, float, all-Spaces, collapsed, hide-completed, sort-to-bottom, `open` (X / bring to front) | targeted column writes → note observer; `open` → manager |
| `move_note` | drag/resize; global coordinates spanning displays, as stored | manager `setFrame` |
| `delete_note` | palette delete | `destructiveHint` |
| `add_tasks` | quick-add, add subtask, add sibling (`after_task_id` + `level`) | `insertTask` / `insertTask(reordering:)` |
| `update_task` | edit text; tick/untick with the bidirectional cascade | `update` / `applyingToggle` + `updateTaskCompletion` |
| `move_task` | drag reorder, indent, outdent | `movingSubtree` + `normalizedLevels` + `applyStructuralUpdate` |
| `delete_tasks`, `clear_completed` | delete, clear completed | `destructiveHint` |
| `set_task_image`, `crop_task_image`, `remove_task_image` | paste, crop (0…1 top-left rect), remove; base64 PNG/JPEG | `TaskImage` helpers + existing writes |

- **Trust boundary validation:** unknown ids → tool error (`isError: true`), text trimmed and
  capped, blank text rejected (deletion is explicit), level 0…`TaskItem.maxIndentLevel`, batch
  and image size capped, colors/materials by raw value.
- **Conventions carry over:** completion changes only via the toggle cascade; structural edits
  never touch `isDone`; level diffs by id (`indentLevelChanges`); targeted column writes only.
  `NoteController.completionChanges` moves to `TaskOutline` so both callers share it.
- **Annotations** (`readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, `idempotentHint`) ride along so clients ask
  the user before an agent deletes anything.
- **Defaults:** a write to a closed note reopens it so the user sees the work.
- **Excluded on purpose:** launch at login, the MCP toggle itself, quit, update check, the
  transient image viewer window. App controls, not note content.

```

- Built like the Lists palette: an `NSPanel` hosting SwiftUI, owned by `AppModel`
  (`openMCPSetup()`), `.regularMaterial`, ~640×420.
- `MCPClients` is one static table: name, config path, snippet shape (`mcpServers` JSON /
  `servers` JSON / TOML / CLI command), optional deeplink. Adding a client is one array entry.
  The executable path is read live from `Bundle.main.executableURL`, so it's right for dev too.
- Preference `mcpEnabled` (UserDefaults, default off); `AppModel.setMCPEnabled` starts/stops the
  listener; `bootstrap()` starts it when on. Status text is the listener's live connection count.
- No activity feed and no highlight animation on agent edits in v1 (the live update already
  shows them). Add the feed when debugging agents gets annoying.

```

### Build order

1. **Spike** (`main.swift`, `MCPProxy`, an echo listener). Verify: the Unix-socket listener
   accepts connections; `swift test` still works with `main.swift` instead of `@main`; a client
   spawning the GUI binary with `--mcp` shows no Dock icon; `claude mcp add tic --
   $PWD/.build/debug/Tic --mcp` then `claude mcp list` reports it connected.
2. **Protocol + tools + tests**: `MCPServer`, `MCPTools`, `observeNote`, controller observer,
   `closeNote`/`setFrame`, `titleText` sync.
3. **Toggle + menu item**, then the **setup window** per the mockup.
4. **Docs**: CLAUDE.md conventions (in-process server, stdio-via-`--mcp`, note observer, direct
   window calls), README and site "Works with AI agents" mention.

### Verification

- `swift build`, `swift test` (the MCP suites drive the dispatcher with JSON-RPC lines over an
  in-memory database).
- Manual, user-driven: enable MCP, add Tic to Claude Code with the command above, then ask it to
  draft a list. Watch: the note appears cascaded; asking it to rename, recolour, roll up, float,
  move, tick a parent (subtree ticks), add subtasks, and delete a task each show instantly in the
  open panel. Toggle MCP off → the agent's next call fails with the stderr hint. Connect a second
  client and confirm "2 connected" and that both see each other's writes via `get_note`.

## Open follow-ups (post-MVP, not built now)

Daily-vs-planned rollover (the signature feature — a Today note that carries unfinished items to
tomorrow), recurring tasks, due dates + Reminders/Calendar, tags/priority, global quick-add
hotkey, **iCloud sync** (its own project with SQLite — either iCloud-Drive the DB file or build
CloudKit record sync; the UUID + `updatedAt` schema keeps this feasible), App Store
notarization.
